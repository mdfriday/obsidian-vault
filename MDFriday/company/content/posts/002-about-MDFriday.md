## 🧭 Our Philosophy

> Focus on your content. Let technology be invisible.

During creation, we often get distracted by:
- Website setup
- Styling and layout
- Deployment pipelines
- SEO configurations

These break the flow of creativity.  
**MDFriday** aims to eliminate all friction —  
so one Markdown file can become a complete, published website.
